# Proxy Backend URL
# Set this to your deployed Vercel proxy URL
# This is safe to expose - it's just the endpoint URL, not a secret
VITE_PROXY_URL=https://your-proxy.vercel.app/api/scrape

# Note: Gemini API keys are managed by users directly in the extension
# through the Options page (chrome.storage.sync), NOT through env variables
